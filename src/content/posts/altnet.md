# altnet - simplifying digital solutions in Alba Iulia

I had the pleasure of developing the official website for altnet, a versatile platform that offers everything from online stores and presentation sites to software development and mobile applications. Altnet aims to streamline the digital transformation journey for businesses, making it easier for them to leverage technology and enhance their services.

## The Vision Behind the Website
The primary goal was to create a user-friendly website that effectively communicates altnet’s diverse offerings while guiding potential clients through the initial steps of engaging with the services. The site needed to be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and optimized for performance. To achieve this, we utilized a tech stack that included **Deno Fresh**, **Preact** and **TailwindCSS**.

- **Deno Fresh** provided a modern framework for building fast and efficient web applications, ensuring optimal performance and quick load times.
- **TailwindCSS** facilitated a clean, responsive design, allowing users to have a seamless experience across devices.
- **Preact** enabled dynamic user interfaces that enhance interactivity and engagement on the site.

#The Biggest Challenge: Ensuring Clarity and Usability
One of the main challenges in this project was ensuring that the website conveyed the breadth of services offered while remaining clear and user-friendly. It was crucial to guide potential clients smoothly through the process of determining their needs and taking the next steps. To tackle this, we focused on creating intuitive navigation and clear calls to action, encouraging users to fill out the contact form and start their digital journey.

## The Result
The final website is an inviting, user-centered platform that effectively showcases altnet’s capabilities. Visitors can easily understand the range of services available, calculate costs transparently, and get started with just a 30% advance.

Building the website for altnet was a rewarding experience, emphasizing the power of technology in facilitating business growth and innovation. I look forward to seeing how altnet continues to impact the local digital landscape.
